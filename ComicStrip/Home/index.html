	Detective Jordan Blake has been called to Ivory Crest Library, a prestigious institution known for housing priceless literary artifacts. Last night, the library’s most prized possession—an original, hand-written manuscript of The Enigma Files—was stolen from its secured glass case. The security cameras mysteriously went dark for exactly five minutes at 11:45 PM, right before the night guard did his rounds.
	Three individuals were inside the library at the time, each with a reason to be there. One of them took the manuscript.
