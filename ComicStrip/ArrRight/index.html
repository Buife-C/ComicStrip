          "Detective Jordan knew the truth as soon as he put the pieces
          together. Lana’s bag was too full, she left during the blackout, and
          she had been writing about security flaws—she knew exactly what to
          exploit."

      <b>How Lana did it:</b>
      <li>She cut the power using a hidden device.</li>
      <li>She swiped the manuscript while the cameras were off.</li>
      <li>She planned to "expose" the security flaws but got greedy.</li>

      <br />
      <b>Lana is arrested. The manuscript is recovered. Case closed.</b>
