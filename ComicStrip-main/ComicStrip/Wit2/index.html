        <em>
          "Felix was in the basement at some point—I remember because I saw him
          heading down there earlier. But he does have access to the security
          system. If anyone could manipulate the cameras, it’s him."

      <h3>Key Clues:</h3>
      <p>
        <li>Fix could have cut the security feed remotely.</li>
        <li>He downplayed the value of the manuscript—is that just an act?</li>
        <li>
          But if he was in the basement, how did he get upstairs in time to
          steal it?
