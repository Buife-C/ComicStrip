          "Look, I’m the tech guy here. When the cameras cut out, I was actually
          in the basement, checking on some faulty wiring. I didn’t even know
          about the theft until this morning! If I wanted to steal something,
          would I be dumb enough to sabotage the very security system I
          maintain? Besides, I barely even knew how valuable that manuscript
          is."
