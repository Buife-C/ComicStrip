          "This is preposterous! I was here last night researching 18th-century
          manuscripts for my upcoming book. The library director allowed me
          special after-hours access—I have an email proving it. I spent the
          entire evening buried in research, and I didn't even leave my desk
          until the guard came in for his rounds. By then, the manuscript was
          already gone!"

          Dr. Graves insists she never left her reading station and that she saw
          no one suspicious. She also claims to be horrified by the crime, given
          her love for rare literature.
