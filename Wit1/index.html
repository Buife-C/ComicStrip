          "Yeah, Dr. Graves was here last night, alright. She seemed real busy,
          hardly looked up when I passed by. But here's the thing—her reading
          desk is on the opposite side of the library from where the cameras
          went out. No way she could've tampered with them, right?"

      <h3>Key Clues:</h3>
      <p>
        <li>
          The guard claims Graves was at her desk, but could she have left
          unnoticed?
        </li>
        <li>
          The email confirming her late-night access only proves she was allowed
          there, not what she did.
        </li>
